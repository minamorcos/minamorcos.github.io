          Linux Tutorial
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Linux is an open source operating system. You can find Linux in a Windows or Mac computer. In Windows, Linux is found in the command prompt, and in MAC OS it is found in terminal. This open source program was created by Linus Torvalds for people to use for practically any project. Most people get confused that Linux is an operating system when it's not, it's the kernel that the operating system runs on. A kernel is the core of a computer's operating system that controls everything in that system.

        <ul>
          <div class="writings_definitions">
            <li><h4> vi </h4></li>
            <p> Able to read commands. Vi is referred to as a screen editor. To use vi, simply input vi (file name) this will open up the file and you will be able to begin doing commits. </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> cd </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "change directory". After cd, the user puts in which file he wants to go into. For example, cd Desktop will change the directory from the current one to another directory. This can only work going forward, you cannot be in a folder in the desktop and try to change the directory to the actual desktop, you will need to go back using "../"n</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> mkdir </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "make directory". This is used to create new folders in the unix code without having to go into the GUI and create a folder manually. Essentially, instead of taking a few click to make a folder in the GUI, we just write "mkdir (foldername)" and a folder will appear in that directory.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> cp </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "copy". This command is used to copy files, groups of files, or directories. This requires you to have to directories, one where the computer is copying the directory, and the other to tell the computer where it is being copied to. To enable, do cp (file location you want to copy) (directory where you want to copy file to)</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> pwd </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "print work directory". This will print the current directory that the user is in at the moment. Simply type in "pwd" into unix and the directory you are in will appear.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> v </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "move". It will move one or more files, or a whole directory to another place of choice. Simply type in mv (file name you want to move) (directory you want to move the file to)</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> rm </h4></li>
            <p> Stands for "remote". This is used to delete files from the directory. Once deleted, you can not recover these files. To use the function type in rm (file name).n</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> history </h4></li>
            <p> Used to show you the previous commands you made in terminal. You can scroll through the history using the up and down arrow keys.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Home Directory </h4></li>
            <p> Repository for the the user's personal files. After logging into the system, this is usually where the user is. To see, easily just open command prompt or terminal and you will be right there. The tilde or ~ is used to denote a user's home directoy. To operate, use ~/(file name).n</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> File paths in linux </h4></li>
            <p>The human readable representation of a file or folder's location on the computer. We use these to find files and add data into them or remove data out of them.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Tab Key </h4></li>
            <p> Convenient for completing file paths. If you know what the file starts with, you can type the first letter and then click tab to scroll through all the files that begin with that name. If you have no idea what's in that file, you can just keep clicking tab and it can show you the files in that directory.

</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Up and Down Arrow Keys </h4></li>
            <p> Used to circle through previous functions you typed into the cmd. This is convenient because you don't have to constantly keep typing the same command over and over again, instead you can circle through the commands and save time and errors. </p>

          Git tracks the changes of source code during the development process. This is important since all developers want to be aware of what changes occured by other developers, creating a clear communication between developers without them really having to speak to one another. Docker is an opensource that delivers software in containers. Automated testing is responsible for executing the commits, basically testing them to see if they work with the file. Essentially, it's a piece of software that tests other software to see if that software is playing nice with the other code. Continious Integration is the process of merging all of the branches several times a day to detect problems in the code early on so that when the code is towards it's finished product, developers don't have to waste time and look through each code to see where the problem lies. These aspects of github improbes productivity of a company since developers can constantly test if there code works with other developers code right then and there instead of waiting for the semi-finished product. Companies also gain a competitive advantage since developers are finding mistakes earlier rather than later, as well as on the same page everyday before the deadline.

HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the » W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.

            <li><h4> id </h4></li>
            <p> An HTML element can have an id attribute to identify it. id elements should always be unique to that single element, and each element should never have more than one id.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> href </h4></li>
            <p> Links tell the browser where to go using an href attribute, which stores a URL.</p>

            <li><h4> Usage </h4></li>
            <p> Almost all content belongs inside the body tag. The main exceptions are script and style tags, as well as the page title tag. As you can see in this example, there is a heading, an image, and a link all inside the body tag. The head tag contains only external files and the page title.</p>

          CSS Tutorial

        <p>
       CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).

          <div class="writings_definitions">
            <li><h4> Comment </h4></li>
            <p> A comment has no effect on the display of the page that’s styled; it’s for the CSS author to read and better understand the code.  </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Rule Set </h4></li>
            <p> A rule set is a single section of CSS including the selector, the curly braces, and the different lines with properties and values.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Declaration Block </h4></li>
            <p> A declaration block is the section of CSS where the property/value pairs appear. </p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Property </h4></li>
            <p> A property is what appears before the colon in any line of CSS.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Value</h4></li>
            <p> A value is what appears immediately after the colon in any line of CSS.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Selector </h4></li>
            <p> A selector is the part of the CSS line that selects what element to target with the property/value pair.</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Class Selector </h4></li>
            <p> The selector in the example below targets an element by its class name. So every element with a class of “navigation” will receive the styles in questionn</p>

            <li><h4> ID selector </h4></li>
            <p> ID Selector
The selector in the example below targets an element by its ID. So every element with an ID of “navigation” will receive the styles in question:</p>
            <hr>
            <li><h4> Pseudo-Class </h4></li>
            <p> A pseudo-class works similarly to a regular CSS class, except it’s not explicitly declared in the HTML.</p>
